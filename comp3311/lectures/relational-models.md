# Relational Modelling
- collection of inter-connected relations (or tables)
- the relation model has one mechanism: relations 
  - each **relation** (denoted R, S, T, ...) has:
    - a name (unique within a given database) 
    - a set of attributes 
  - each **attribute** (denoted A, B etc.) has:
    - a name (unique within a given relation)
    - an associated domain (set of allowed values)
