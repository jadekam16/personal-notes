## ER to Relational Mapping 
- perform initial data modelling using ER 
- transform ER into relational model 

**Differences between relational and ER** 
- rel uses relations to model entities & relationships
- rel has no composite/multi-valued attributes 
- rel has no object-oriented notions (subclasses, inheritance)

### Mapping Strong Entities 
- entity set E with attributes a1, a2,... aN maps to a relation R with attributes (columns) a1, a2, ... aN
