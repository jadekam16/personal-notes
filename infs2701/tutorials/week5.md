# Week 5 Tutorial: Cambridge Analytica 

## Summary 
A Cambridge University professor created a Facebook quiz app that collected personal data from users and their friends without explicit consent. This app harvested data from approximately 75 million Facebook profiles. Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, acquired this data and used it to create detailed psychological profiles of individuals. The company used these profiles to target personalised political advertisements, particularly during the 2016 US Presidential election and the Brexit referendum in the UK.

## Key Insights 
The Cambridge Analytica case study provides several key insights into the controversial data analytics firm's practices and their impact on political campaigns and privacy:

- Data Collection and Exploitation: Cambridge Analytica harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users without their explicit consent, using a personality quiz app called "thisisyourdigitallife".

- Psychological Profiling: The company used the collected data to create detailed psychological profiles of individuals, which were then used to target personalized political advertisements.

- Political Influence: Cambridge Analytica played a significant role in major political campaigns, including Donald Trump's 2016 US presidential campaign and the Brexit referendum in the UK.

- Ethical Concerns: The case raised serious ethical questions about data privacy, consent, and the manipulation of public opinion through targeted advertising.

- Regulatory Impact: The scandal led to increased scrutiny of data protection practices and contributed to the implementation of stricter regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.

- Facebook's Responsibility: The case highlighted Facebook's inadequate data protection measures and raised questions about the platform's responsibility in safeguarding user information.

- Public Awareness: The scandal increased public awareness about data privacy issues and the potential misuse of personal information on social media platforms.

- Company Downfall: The controversy ultimately led to the closure of Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, in 2018.

- Broader Implications: The case study demonstrates the power of big data and analytics in shaping public opinion and influencing democratic processes, raising concerns about the future of privacy and democracy in the digital age.

These insights highlight the complex interplay between technology, data, privacy, and politics in the modern era, emphasizing the need for robust data protection measures and ethical considerations in the use of personal information.

    - Consequences: The scandal led to significant public outcry, regulatory scrutiny, and the eventual closure of Cambridge Analytica.Exploitation of this data for political campaigns, including the 2016 US Presidential election.
  
1. Evaluate Meta's Data Privacy and Management Measures
Critically evaluate the changes Meta has implemented in response to the scandal, focusing on improvements in data management practices, user consent mechanisms, and data access controls.
- Key Points:
    - Improved Data Management Practices: Meta (formerly Facebook) has implemented stricter data management protocols to ensure data integrity and security.
    - User Consent Mechanisms: Enhanced mechanisms for obtaining explicit user consent before data collection and usage.
    - Data Access Controls: Strengthened controls to limit access to user data and prevent unauthorized use.The case study doesn't provide information on Meta's subsequent measures. However, it implies that Facebook's initial data management practices were inadequate, allowing for:
        - Exploitation of API loopholes
        - Insufficient control over third-party app data access
        - Lack of robust user consent mechanisms
  
1. Explore User Rights and Data Management Tools
Understand the tools and features Meta provides to help users manage their personal data, including viewing, managing, downloading, and deleting information.
- Key Points:
    - Data Management Tools: Meta offers tools for users to view, manage, download, and delete their personal data.
    - User Rights: Users have the right to control their data, including the ability to revoke consent and request data deletion.
    - Transparency: Meta has increased transparency regarding data collection and usage practices, providing users with more information about how their data is used.
- While the case study doesn't directly address Meta's current tools, it highlights the need for:
    - Transparent data collection practices
    - User control over personal data
    - Clear consent mechanisms for data sharing
    - Tools for users to view, manage, and delete their data

The scandal underscores the importance of these features, which were lacking at the time of the incident.
