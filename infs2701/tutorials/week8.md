Identify-P:

• Medibank could have better identified privacy risks related to the theft of credentials by:
- Implementing more robust third-party risk assessment processes, especially for contractors with privileged access like the IT Service Desk Operator[1].
- Conducting regular security assessments of tools and practices used to access important data repositories, including personal devices used by contractors[1].
- Performing regular password usage audits and enforcing stricter password policies[1].

• Data processing actions and elements that should have been inventoried and mapped include:
- Privileged access accounts and their associated permissions, particularly the Admin Account which had access to most of Medibank's systems[1].
- Critical information assets and data repositories, such as the MARS Database containing sensitive customer information[1].
- Data flows, especially those involving sensitive customer information, including health data and claims information[1].

Govern-P:

• Governance policies, processes, and procedures Medibank should have implemented:
- Proper change management controls for information security controls[1].
- Regular reviews of privileged accounts and their access rights[1].
- Comprehensive incident response procedures, including proper triage and escalation of security alerts[1].

• To improve privacy risk management strategies, Medibank could have:
- Addressed the deficiencies identified in various reports and documents (Annexure C)[1].
- Implemented and enforced the measures outlined in Annexure B of the court document[1].

Control-P:

• Data processing controls that could have mitigated unauthorized access risks:
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access and critical systems, particularly for VPN access[1].
- Appropriate privileged access management controls[1].
- Enhanced monitoring and proper triage of alerts generated by the Endpoint Detection and Response Security Software[1].

• To manage data with sufficient granularity, Medibank could have:
- Implemented data minimization practices.
- Applied the principle of least privilege more rigorously, especially for contractor access[1].
- Employed better data segmentation and access controls to prevent extensive data exfiltration (approximately 520 gigabytes)[1].

Communicate-P:

• Medibank should have communicated with stakeholders about privacy practices and risks by:
- Providing clear, timely, and transparent information about the data breach, especially given that they were unaware of the data exfiltration until at least October 16, 2022[1].
- Regularly updating customers on privacy practices and potential risks.

• Communication policies and procedures that should have been in place:
- A comprehensive incident response communication plan.
- Regular privacy and security awareness training for employees and contractors, particularly regarding the risks of saving credentials on personal devices[1].

Protect-P:

• Protective measures that should have been implemented:
- Enhanced password complexity requirements and monitoring[1].
- Improved security monitoring processes to detect and respond to incidents quickly, including proper triage of security alerts[1].
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing[1].

• To prevent cybersecurity-related privacy events, Medibank could have:
- Implemented stronger access controls, including MFA for critical systems and VPN access[1].
- Improved monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities, with proper escalation procedures[1].
- Conducted more frequent and comprehensive security audits[1].
- Implemented the measures outlined in Annexure B of the court document[1].

The Medibank data breach highlights significant gaps in the company's privacy and security practices across all core functions of the NIST Privacy Framework. The court document reveals that Medibank was aware of serious deficiencies in its cybersecurity framework from at least the beginning of the relevant period[1]. By addressing these gaps, particularly in areas such as access control, monitoring, and incident response, Medibank could have potentially prevented or mitigated the impact of the breach that affected approximately 9.7 million individuals[1].
